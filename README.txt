# Escapee-Game
project from SJSU
The game is currently only Linux runnable. I will transfer to Visual Studio soon and compile it there to make it Windows runnable. The executable for linux is called EscapeeGame. 

The controls for the game are the Arrow Keys for movement. The camera should follow the player when he reaches close to the edge.  WASD controls the camera independently. 

Contact with an enemy results in Death message. The win condition is getting to the colored tile at the end without touching the enemies.
